At Fine ART IMAGE

we seek to express the beauty of the

Natural World. Our visual artists create evocative images

that have a sense of mystery, and resonate with the energy

of light. Our mission is to capture the fragile beauty of

our environment and to encourage efforts for its

preservation.

Currently, we are developing new visual projects 

while traveling the world. In Eastern Kentucky we

created images of farm communities in transition. In Afghanistan we explored the plight of children in orphanages and refugee camps in countries torn by war and natural disaster. In the concrete jungles of American cities we examine the growing issue of hunger and the homeless. In Central America the vibrancy of street vendors and Farmers markets. We are informed and inspired by our understanding of the interconnectedness of all things.
