  At Fine Art Image we seek to express the beauty of the Natural World. Our
  visual artists create evocative images that have a sense of mystery and
  resonate with the energy of light. Our mission is to capture the fragile
  beauty of our environment and to encourage efforts for its preservation.
  Currently, we are creating new visual projects while traveling the world. In
  eastern Kentucky we documented farm communities in transition. In Afghanistan
  we explored the plight of orphaned children and survivors in the squalor of
  refugee camps in countries torn by conflict or natural disaster. In the
  Concrete Jungles of American cities we witness the growing populations of
  those ravaged by hunger and homelessness. In Central America and the Caribbean
  our lens is focused on alternate methods of food production and the role of
  local Farmers Markets. Our journeys have informed and inspired by our belief
  in, and our understanding of, the interconnectedness of all things. Â©2016 Fine
