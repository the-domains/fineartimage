  At Fine Art Image we seek to express the beauty of the Natural World. Our
  visual artists create evocative images of the Natural World that have a sense
  of mystery, and resonate with the energy of light. Our mission is to capture
  the fragile beauty of our environment while encouraging efforts for its
  preservation. Currently, we are developing new visual projects while traveling
  the world. In Eastern Kentucky we created images of farm communities in
  transition. In Afghanistan we explored the plight of children in orphanages
  and refugee camps in countries torn by war or natural disaster. In the
  concrete jungles of American cities we examine the growing issue of hunger and
  the homeless. In Central America we captured the vibrancy of street vendors
  and Farmers Markets. Our images are informed and inspired by our recognition
  of the interconnectedness of all things. Â©2016 fine art image | all rights
